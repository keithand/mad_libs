		<h3>Charly and the Reaper</h3>

		<img alt="Charly reading" src="images/man_reading.jpg" id="man_reading" />

		<p>Charly was sitting in his livingroom in his easy chair <span class="verb_ing"></span> a book. It was dark outside, and a light breeze was blowing. All was <span class="adjective"></span> and quiet, a nice evening for reading a book. Then he heard a sound, <span class="sound"></span>, but he had not a clock that made a noise. Then it went away, and all was quiet, again. No other noise. He continued to read his book. Soon, he put his <span class="noun"></span> in his book, laid it on the side table, and stood up.

Then came this voice, a cold raspy voice, "It is time, Charly. I have come for you." Charly wanted to scream, but it stuck in his throat the fear gripped him so bad. Suddenly, a cold, wet hand reached out and grabbed his arm, "Charly, it is time!" Then, just as he felt that he was going to die... </p>
